# todolist
A ToDo List Application made using Backbone.js

The app adds a new todo item to the list, deletes items, and checks off completed items.
It uses Backbone's Models, Collections and Views to make a clean, perfectly structured, maintainable code. 
We have also used templating and connected the app to a fake online REST API for prototyping.

You can download the source code, open the index.html file using brackets and click on live preview to see the working app.
